# UWP Roblox Dumper
An offset dumper for the microsoft store version of roblox which dumps all the necessary offsets for my [UWP Executor](https://github.com/Spoorloos/uwp_executor). I wrote this in python because the pymem library made it extremely easy.

## Dependencies
```console
pip install pymem
```
